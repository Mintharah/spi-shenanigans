/*
 * system_clock_config.c
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Corrected SystemClock_Config() for the STM32F401CC "Black Pill".
 *
 * Replaces the broken version that left the PLL OFF -- the core ran on raw HSI
 * at 16 MHz while the build assumed 84 MHz, so every TIM/ADC/SPI timing was off
 * by 5.25x. This brings the part to its real 84 MHz target.
 *
 * HSI 16 MHz -> PLL -> 84 MHz:
 *     VCO in  = HSI / PLLM = 16 / 16   = 1   MHz   (valid 1-2 MHz)
 *     VCO out = VCO in * PLLN = 1 * 336 = 336 MHz   (valid 100-432 MHz)
 *     SYSCLK  = VCO out / PLLP = 336 / 4 = 84  MHz
 * Bus clocks: HCLK = 84, PCLK1 = 42 (APB1 max), PCLK2 = 84 MHz.
 *
 * Two things that MUST accompany 84 MHz on the F401 (at VDD 2.7-3.6 V):
 *   - Voltage scaling = Scale 2  (Scale 3 tops out at 60 MHz).
 *   - Flash latency   = 2 wait states, set BEFORE the clock is raised.
 * HAL_RCC_ClockConfig() applies the flash latency in the correct order relative
 * to the SYSCLK switch, so passing FLASH_LATENCY_2 here is what prevents the
 * bus-fault-on-first-instruction-fetch you'd get from an un-raised latency.
 *
 * This is the HAL/CubeMX form (you have a SystemClock_Config(), which is the HAL
 * convention). On LL or register-level, say so and I'll give that form -- the
 * numbers are identical, only the API changes.
